## Installation Instructions
- download and install backend repo
- create an admin user in the backend
- download frontend repo and run npm i to install all dependencies
- with backend running, npm start the app
- create an account (or login as your admin), and start browsing Products

## General Approach
I wanted to get a deeper understanding of react. Since eccommence is on the raise, i thought this will be my perfect final project. Showcasing what i've learned in and out of class. By showcasing my skills for basic functionality 

## Stretch Goals
- Checkout and payment page
- Create filter/categories on the products page
- Inprove the overall design of the website

## Major Hurdles
- Setting up the backend product model. It was a big challenge in knowing which model or product is a role or object/ref of the other
